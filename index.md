**Independent Consultant · Adjunct Research Assistant Professor, Temple University**

I provide independent quantitative evaluation of environmental and carbon systems. My work sits at the intersection of ecological modeling, remote sensing, uncertainty analysis, and operational data systems.

I work with organizations that need rigorous technical judgment, clear analysis, and execution that stands up to scrutiny — from field design through model implementation and reporting.
